   - **Techniques**: GUI Programming, Real-Time Clock
   - **Libraries Used**: `Tkinter`

### 3. **Extractive Text Summarization**
   - **Description**: This project performs automatic summarization of long text documents by extracting key sentences. It uses the concept of extractive summarization where important sentences are selected from the text.
   - **Techniques**: Natural Language Processing, Text Summarization
   - **Libraries Used**: `nltk`, `spacy`, `gensim`

### 4. **Facebook Video Downloader**

   - **Techniques**: Gesture Recognition, OpenCV
   - **Libraries Used**: `OpenCV`, `mediapipe`, `pygame`

### 6. **Handwritten-Assignments**
   - **Description**: A system that recognizes and grades handwritten assignments. This project processes scanned images of handwritten answers and attempts to grade or analyze the content based on pre-trained models.
   - **Techniques**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Machine Learning
   - **Libraries Used**: `pytesseract`, `tensorflow`, `keras`

### 7. **Helmet Detection**
   - **Description**: This project detects whether a person is wearing a helmet in images or video streams. It uses deep learning models to classify the presence or absence of a helmet.
   - **Techniques**: Object Detection, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
   - **Libraries Used**: `OpenCV`, `tensorflow`, `keras`

### 8. **Image Compression**
   - **Description**: This project reduces the size of images without significant quality loss. It compresses image files, making them easier to store and transfer.
   - **Techniques**: Image Compression, File I/O
   - **Libraries Used**: `PIL`, `opencv`

### 9. **Image Size Reducer**
   - **Description**: This tool helps reduce the resolution of images to decrease file size. It is particularly useful for uploading images to websites or social media where file size is restricted.
   - **Techniques**: Image Processing, File Compression
   - **Libraries Used**: `PIL`, `opencv`

### 10. **Merge PDFs**
   - **Description**: A simple script to merge multiple PDF files into one. This project is useful for combining documents or reports into a single file.
   - **Techniques**: PDF Manipulation
   - **Libraries Used**: `PyPDF2`

### 11. **Movie Scraper**
   - **Description**: This script allows users to scrape movie data (e.g., name, genre, rating, plot) from online movie databases like IMDb and store them in a structured format.
   - **Techniques**: Web Scraping, Data Extraction
   - **Libraries Used**: `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`

### 12. **OCR Image-to-Text Conversion**
   - **Description**: This project uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert images of printed or handwritten text into editable text. It supports various image formats.
   - **Techniques**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Image Processing
   - **Libraries Used**: `pytesseract`, `PIL`

### 13. **Password Generator**
   - **Description**: A script that generates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (e.g., letters, numbers, symbols).
   - **Techniques**: Randomization, Security
   - **Libraries Used**: `random`, `string`

### 14. **Plagiarism-Checker**
   - **Description**: This tool checks for plagiarism in text by comparing the given text against online sources and databases. It identifies similar text and provides a plagiarism score.
   - **Techniques**: Text Comparison, Web Scraping
   - **Libraries Used**: `nltk`, `requests`

### 15. **QR Code Generator**
   - **Description**: A script that generates QR codes based on user input (e.g., URLs, text). It outputs the generated QR code as an image that can be scanned.
   - **Techniques**: QR Code Generation, Encoding
   - **Libraries Used**: `qrcode`, `PIL`

### 16. **Resume Builder**
   - **Description**: This project allows users to create a professional resume by filling in their personal and professional details. The project generates the resume in a downloadable format (e.g., PDF).
   - **Techniques**: File Generation, PDF Creation
   - **Libraries Used**: `reportlab`, `jinja2`

### 17. **Validate-Email**
   - **Description**: This script validates whether an email address is formatted correctly and checks if the domain exists. Itâ€™s useful for cleaning email lists and ensuring valid contact information.
