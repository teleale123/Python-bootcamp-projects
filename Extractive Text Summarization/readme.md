# üìù Advanced Extractive Text Summarization Model

Welcome to the **Advanced Extractive Text Summarization Model**! This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to automatically distill essential points from lengthy content, making it an invaluable tool for handling reports, research papers, news articles, and more.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This model leverages NLP to:
- **Extract key sentences** from a body of text.
- **Score sentences** based on their importance using features like **TF-IDF**, sentence length, position, and presence of named entities.
- **Cluster related sentences** via **K-means** to highlight critical points from various thematic groups.

### Why It Matters
In today‚Äôs information-dense world, quickly understanding critical points from long documents is essential. This model saves time and boosts productivity by providing concise summaries while preserving core insights.

## üìä Features

1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Cleans and prepares text data for effective summarization.
   
2. **Scoring & Ranking**  
   - Scores sentences based on TF-IDF, sentence structure, and key entities.
   
3. **Clustering & Key Point Extraction**  
   - Uses K-means clustering to group sentences by topic and select key sentences for each group.
   
4. **Summary Generation**  
   - Combines top-ranked sentences from each cluster to create a coherent, impactful summary.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Initial cleaning (e.g., removing stop words, punctuation).
2. **Sentence Scoring:** Uses TF-IDF, sentence structure, and named entity recognition to evaluate sentence importance.
3. **K-means Clustering:** Groups related sentences to capture diverse perspectives within the text.
4. **Summarization:** Extracts top sentences across clusters to create a balanced summary.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/one-alive/extractive_text_summarization.git
   cd extractive_text_summarization
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. **Run the Model on a Sample Text:**
   ```bash
   python summarize.py
   ```

2. **Adjust Parameters:** You can tune parameters such as the number of clusters, sentence selection criteria, and summary length for better results based on the text type.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Next Steps

- **Parameter Tuning:** Experiment with different clustering techniques and scoring weights.
- **Expand Dataset Compatibility:** Optimize for specific types of documents like research papers or news articles.
- **Add Fine-Tuning:** Integrate more NLP models to improve summarization accuracy.
